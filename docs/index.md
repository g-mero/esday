# EsDay

EsDay is a JavaScript library inspired by [Day.js](https://github.com/iamkun/dayjs).

EsDay has an API largely similar to [Moment.js](https://momentjs.com/docs/) (v2.30.1) and Day.js (v1.11.13), but it is written in TypeScript and fully supports es modules. When there are differences between Moment.js and Day.js, the functionality of Moment.js is usually preferred.

EsDay supports many locales. A list of the supported locales can be found in the [details page](./locales/locales.md).
